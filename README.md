# React Movie Search App

## [🔗 Check the live site here](https://movie-search-react-2020.netlify.app/)

This is a Movie library app where you can search for any movies. This App is created with React and for state management I have used React hooks.
I used [TMDB Api](https://themoviedb.org) for getting all the movies.

Main Features:

-   View Featured movies on the first page
-   Search for a Movie
-   React Hooks for state management
-   Working with TMDB API
