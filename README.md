# React Movie Search App

This is a Movie library app where you can search for any movies. This App is created with React and for state management I have used React hooks.
I used [TMDB Api](https://themoviedb.org) for getting all the movies.

Main Features:

- View Featured movies on the first page
- Search for a Movie
- React Hooks for state management
- Working with TMDB API
